      My name is Bruno Domenico. I live and always lived in a spetacular
      city here in Brazil called Belo Horizonte (Beautiful Horizon in a
      rough translation). I actually want to describe the city but I should
      focus on describing me, as this section commands. Who am I? This is a
      portfolio page so this question <em>should</em> be easy to answer: I
      am a web and software developer looking for a myriad of opportunities.
      Opportunities for self development, for sharing, for caring, and for
      honest work. I should make a list here of my 'hard' skills, but that's
      why I have a github page, you should check that out if you haven't
      already. Maybe I should make a list of my soft skills, but you
      shouldn't trust any soft skills lists in the web, as we know, it could
      be fake. <strong>SO I HAVE FINALLY DECIDED</strong> to write here my
      special and unique skill set list, I hope you like it.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <h3>My Special Skill List</h3>
      <li>
        I can improvise songs on the spot, and I actually record a lot of
        them.
      </li>
      <li>I can eat alot.</li>
      <li>
        I can critique. (Or fake a critique when I don't know what I am
        talking about). I think of myself as a very good critique for
        anything 'form' related, but this isn't something that good
        critiques should say out loud. Maybe I should cross this line out.
        That is actually one of my issues too as I can't be 100% critic
        about my work, because if I am, I do not go foward and I just keep
        eternally mending mistakes. So I am constantly learning to let go of
        this perfectionist critique side of me, on that note, I love to
        recieve criticism too
      </li>
      <li>
        I am very good at questing through the web and beyond to find hard
        to find stuff.
      </li>
      <li>I <em>do</em> know kung fu just like Dwight and Neo</li>
      <li>I am a very good and patient listener, sometimes to a fault.</li>
      <li>I am a totó master</li>
      <li>I knew my Pokemon stuff well back in my days.</li>
      <li>I do not drink soda anymore.</li>
    </ul>
