      My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunodnc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bruno Domenico</a>. Who am I? This is a
      portfolio page so this question <em>should</em> be easy to answer: I
      am a web developer looking for a myriad of opportunities.
      Opportunities for self development, for sharing, for caring, and for
      honest work.

      You can use this page as a bridge to access my <a href="#projects">Projects</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/brunodnc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">code</a>!
